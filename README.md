Briscola is a Mediterranean trick-taking card game played with a standard Italian 40-card deck. <br>
For model of this app I used Sicilian type. <br>
For the purpose of calculating total score the cards have the following point value:<br>

* Ace: 11 points
* Three: 10 points
* King: 4 points
* Horse: 3 points
* Woman: 2 points <br>
The remaining cards have no point value

As you can see, the total value of cards in the deck adds up to 120 points.
<br> Therefore, the player or team which scores 61 points or more wins the game.<br>
